# Editors

Exercism provides its own online editor, which is adequate for solving the exercises.
However, it offers a somewhat limited experience when it comes to learning and experimenting with Clojure.

The most effective way to develop in Clojure is by using an editor-connected REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
Plugins are available for most popular editors and IDEs:

- Emacs: [CIDER](https://cider.mx)
- IntelliJ: [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com)
- VSCode: [Calva](https://calva.io)
- Vim: [Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure)

See the [official guide](https://clojure.org/guides/editors) for more info.
