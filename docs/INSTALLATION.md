# Installation

Exercism supports the following two command-line tools for installing and using Clojure:

## Clojure CLI

The Clojure CLI runs Clojure programs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
It uses `deps.edn` files to configure and download dependencies.
To install the tool, follow the [official instructions](https://clojure.org/reference/clojure_cli) on the Clojure website.

Another way to install Clojure on Windows is via the [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) package manager. You can find detailed instructions in the [scoop-clojure GitHub repo](https://github.com/littleli/scoop-clojure).

## Leiningen

Leiningen is another tool that runs Clojure programs on the JVM.
It uses a single `project.clj` file to configure and download dependencies.
To install the tool, follow the [official instructions](https://leiningen.org) on its website.
